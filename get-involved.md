Civic Spark is built by a community of volunteers — and we’re looking for partners, collaborators, and supporters to help bring it to life. Whether you want to shape the program, support the community, or help make it all run smoothly, there’s a role for you.

## Become a Sponsor

Support the ecosystem, not just the event.

We’re seeking values-aligned sponsors who believe in community-powered innovation, public good tech, and civic collaboration. Sponsorship helps us keep the event accessible, support grassroots participation, and celebrate 10 years of Civic Tech Toronto.

Let’s talk: sponsorship@civic-spark.com

## Propose a Session or Suggest a Speaker

Help shape the conversation.

Civic Spark is built around real stories, lived experience, and community-grounded work — and we want to hear from you.

If you’ve got a story, project, question, or practice worth sharing, we invite you to propose a session. It could be a talk, a workshop, a discussion — or something in between.

Or, if you know someone whose voice should be in the room — someone doing the work, whether they call it “civic tech” or not — we’d love to hear about them.

## Suggest a Speaker

Propose a Session

Join as an Advisor or Community Partner

Help us shape what matters.

We’re inviting a small group of advisors and community collaborators to guide our programming, suggest speakers, and connect us to people and projects that need to be seen. No heavy time commitment — just shared purpose and occasional input.

Reach out: speak@civic-spark.com

## Volunteer with Us

This is a volunteer-powered event — and we’d love your help!

From day-of logistics to helping review sessions, Civic Spark runs on community energy. If you want to lend your time and skills (or just be part of the behind-the-scenes team), we’d love to have you.

Sign up to volunteer here: volunteers@civic-spark.com
