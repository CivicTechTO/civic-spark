## Conference Overview

<span class="lead">This isn’t a product pitch stage. It’s a space to <strong>share real stories</strong>, <strong>reflect on hard-won lessons</strong>, and <strong>explore what’s possible</strong> when we build with care, creativity, and community.</span>

The Civic Spark Conference kicks off with a curated day of panels, talks, and workshops — spotlighting the people building community-powered tools, services, and networks across North America.

You can expect:

- Lived experience, not just expertise
- Reflections on practice, not polished narratives
- Lessons from the field, not pitches
- Space to listen, learn, and be inspired
