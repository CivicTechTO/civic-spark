      <p>On the second day, the event will transition into an <strong>unconference</strong> format — a participant-driven model where you shape the agenda. We’ll be using a series of modern, flexible classrooms and collaboration spaces located on the <strong>3rd through 5th floors</strong> of the Myhal Centre.</p>
      <p>These spaces are designed for interactive, small-group discussions and workshops, featuring the technology enhanced active learning <strong>(TEAL)</strong> rooms equipped with whiteboards, movable furniture, and projection systems.</p>
      <p>Whether you're hosting a session, leading a discussion, or joining a spontaneous brainstorm, the environment is set up to support creativity, inclusivity, and deep engagement.</p>
