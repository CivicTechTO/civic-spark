Event Overview

## Why Now

Civic infrastructure is fragile.

Public trust is eroding. And too often, the people closest to the problems are furthest from decision-making power.

The challenges are big, the systems are strained, and our efforts for change can feel fragmented, exhausting, and uncertain.

**Civic Spark is a chance to come together.**

For the builders, the connectors, and the quiet experimenters — people who are organizing, innovating, and creating a more equitable public life.

Let’s share what’s working — and name what’s not.

Let’s make space for action that’s meaningful, grounded, and real.

Let’s learn what others are working on, and co-create what’s next.

With purpose. With people. With the belief that we can still build together — across roles, sectors, and lived experience.

This is your invitation.

Share your story. Spark connection. Shape what’s next.

## Programme

The shape of Civic Spark reflects the way we believe change happens — collaboratively, experimentally, and in community.

Civic Spark unfolds over two days — one curated, one emergent. Together, they create space for both structured learning and open exploration. Whether you’re sharing a story, joining a discussion, or just taking it all in, this is a space to listen, reflect, connect, and act.

### Day One: Conference

Stories, sessions, and shared lessons

The first day features a curated schedule of talks, panels, and workshops from people building community-powered tools, services, and networks. It’s a space to share what’s working, reflect on hard-won lessons, and explore new ideas together.

Expect:

- Lived experience, not just expertise
- Reflections on practice and impact
- Lessons from the field, not product pitches
- Room to listen, learn, and be inspired

### Day Two: Unconference

You set the agenda. We build it together.

The second day is an unconference — meaning the agenda is created by participants, on the day of. Anyone can propose a session. Anyone can host. This is where we dive deeper, get hands-on, explore tough questions, and connect around shared interests.

Expect:

- Open conversations and peer learning
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Skill shares, breakout discussions, and idea testing
- A space to follow up on what sparked during Day One

No slides required. Just show up curious.

### Conference Themes

The programming at Civic Spark is shaped around three core themes. These are not rigid tracks — they’re invitations to share stories, ask questions, and reflect on what it takes to build meaningful civic impact together.

#### Building Together

Community Innovation and Mutual Aid—How do we co-create civic tools, services, and support networks from the ground up?

_This theme is about community-led projects, grassroots collaboration, and the messy, creative work of building with care — not just code. From participatory design to mutual aid infrastructure, we want to hear how people are organizing and experimenting together._

#### Tech That Serves

Grounding Tools in Real Needs—How do communities use technology to achieve their own socially aligned outcomes?

_We’re looking for stories that go beyond hype — where tools are designed with and for communities. This includes digital and analog approaches, building data and tech literacy, and creating infrastructure that supports equity, accessibility, and trust._

#### Intersections of Change

Collaborating Across Sectors—How can communities, government, academia, and nonprofits be better together?

_Civic challenges rarely sit in one silo. This theme explores what’s working (and what’s not) when people try to bridge roles, institutions, and power dynamics. We welcome frameworks, real-world case studies, and honest lessons from cross-sector collaboration._
