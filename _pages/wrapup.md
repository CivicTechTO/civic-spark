### Words of thanks

**To our attendees**, thank you for taking a chance on something new. For many of you, this was your first Civic Spark â€” it was ours too. Your presence, your openness, and your willingness to connect brought it to life.

**To our speakers and facilitators** â€” thank you for your generosity, your thoughtfulness, and the sparks you lit. You gave us ideas to carry, questions to wrestle with, and permission to be honest. ([Visit the speakers list](/conference/speakers/))

- **To our conference speakers**, thank you for the care you brought to preparing your sessions and sharing your stories.
- **To our unconference facilitators**, thank you for your vulnerability and courage in opening space for real dialogue.
- **To our emcees and moderators**, thank you for weaving the threads, grounding the flow, and helping us move through the weekend as a shared experience.

**To our volunteers**, thank you for holding the space with warmth, care, and clarity. You made Civic Spark feel less like a conference and more like a community.

**To our supporters and sponsors**, thank you for believing in a community-led vision and helping us build it from the ground up.

- **To our sponsors and partner organizations**, your support made this gathering possible. Thank you for investing in civic connection, shared learning, and community development.
- **To the individuals who bought supporter-tier tickets or made quiet, anonymous contributions** â€“ Thank you for backing this vision, even (and especially) behind the scenes.

**And to our organizing crew** â€” we did it.

We dreamt big and held the shape of this whole thing until it could become a reality. We made a space where ideas could land, connections could spark, and people could feel part of something bigger.

To everyone who gave their evenings, weekends, and inboxes to this â€” let's take a moment to appreciate what we've sparked together (and read through the <a href="#kindwords">kind words</a> sent our way).
