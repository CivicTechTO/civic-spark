  <h2 class="colorized-orange">Overview</h2>
  <p><span class="lead colorized-orange">It’s not a set of talks. It’s a day we build as a group.</span></p>
  <p>Day 2 at Civic Spark is where we figure things out — together.</p>
  <p>Anyone can pitch a session. Anyone can lead. The agenda comes from what’s real, what’s emerging, and what we still have questions about.</p>
  <p>You don’t need slides. Just a starting point — a thread to pull on, an idea to unpack, or a challenge you’ve been sitting with.</p>

  <h2 class="colorized-orange">How It Works</h2>
  <p>After a day of sessions, stories, and shared lessons on Saturday, Sunday flips the script.</p>
  <ul>
<li><strong class="colorized-orange">Pitch a session</strong>: Bring a topic, question, or challenge. You don’t have to have the answer — just something worth exploring with others.</li>
<li><strong class="colorized-orange">Shape the day</strong>: Throughout the day, we’ll build the schedule together. You’ll add your session idea to the unconference board, see what others are proposing, and we'll cluster around what resonates.</li>
<li><strong class="colorized-orange">Join in</strong>: Every session is open. Step into a conversation, bring your perspective, or just follow your curiosity.</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll have a physical session board in the space to coordinate the day — so you’ll always know what’s happening, where, and when. Sessions will be grouped by theme, interest, or energy, with support from our facilitation team.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="colorized-orange">What Makes It Work</h2>

We keep the structure light but intentional. Sessions are supported by a process that helps groups move from good conversations to something deeper.

We aim for sessions that are:

- **Grounded** – Built on lived experience and real needs
- **Collaborative** – Bringing together different forms of insight
- **Focused** – Clear enough to move somewhere useful
- **Inclusive** – Open by design, not gatekept by expertise

We’ll help with timekeeping, materials, and light facilitation support. You bring the good questions and ideas.

<h2 class="colorized-orange">What Happens After</h2>

At the end of the day, we’ll host a collective wrap-up and showcase. You’ll get to see what other groups explored — and maybe find collaborators for what comes next.

<h2 class="colorized-orange">Who It’s For</h2>

If you’re coming to Civic Spark, this is for you.

Whether you’re deep in the work or just starting to explore, this is a space to test ideas, ask questions, and think out loud with others who care.

No slides, no sales, no performance required.
