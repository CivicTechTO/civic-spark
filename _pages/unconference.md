## Overview

<span class="lead">It’s not a set of talks. It’s a day we build as a group.</span>

Day 2 at Civic Spark is where we figure things out — together.

Anyone can pitch a session. Anyone can lead. The agenda comes from what’s real, what’s emerging, and what we still have questions about.

You don’t need slides. Just a starting point — a thread to pull on, an idea to unpack, or a challenge you’ve been sitting with.

## How It Works

After a day of sessions, stories, and shared lessons on Saturday, Sunday flips the script.

- **Pitch a session**: Bring a topic, question, or challenge. You don’t have to have the answer — just something worth exploring with others.
- **Shape the day**: Throughout the day, we’ll build the schedule together. You’ll add your session idea to the unconference board, see what others are proposing, and we'll cluster around what resonates.
- **Join in**: Every session is open. Step into a conversation, bring your perspective, or just follow your curiosity.

We’ll have a physical session board in the space to coordinate the day — so you’ll always know what’s happening, where, and when. Sessions will be grouped by theme, interest, or energy, with support from our facilitation team.

## What Makes It Work

We keep the structure light but intentional. Sessions are supported by a process that helps groups move from good conversations to something deeper.

We aim for sessions that are:

- **Grounded** – Built on lived experience and real needs
- **Collaborative** – Bringing together different forms of insight
- **Focused** – Clear enough to move somewhere useful
- **Inclusive** – Open by design, not gatekept by expertise

We’ll help with timekeeping, materials, and light facilitation support. You bring the good questions and ideas.

## Session Flow (Roughly)

Every 90–120 min session will generally move through:

- Connect – Share context, stories, and experience
- Define – Get clear on the challenge or question
- Diverge – Open up the space, explore ideas
- Converge – Narrow in on key insights or directions
- Prototype (optional) – Sketch or map something out
- Commit – Capture what surfaced and what’s next

It’s flexible. It’s not about solving everything. It’s about surfacing what matters.

## What Happens After

At the end of the day, we’ll host a collective wrap-up and showcase. You’ll get to see what other groups explored — and maybe find collaborators for what comes next.

## Who It’s For

If you’re coming to Civic Spark, this is for you.

Whether you’re deep in the work or just starting to explore, this is a space to test ideas, ask questions, and think out loud with others who care.

No slides, no sales, no performance required.
