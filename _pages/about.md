      <h2>People Powered</h2>
      <p>Civic Spark is a people-organized gathering created by volunteers from Toronto who believe in building together – across roles, sectors, and lived experience.</p>
      <p>We’re designers, developers, public servants, organizers, and community builders who care deeply about how technology, data, and design can serve the public good.</p>
      <p>This isn’t a corporate event — it’s a collaborative effort grounded in care, curiosity, and community. We’re here to hold space for real stories, meaningful relationships, and the hard, hopeful work of civic action.</p>

## Our Why

<p class="lead">We envision a vibrant, people-centered civic ecosystem where communities use technology, organizing, and design to tackle real-world challenges — collaboratively, equitably, and creatively.</p>

For us Civic Spark is a space to:

- Spark new relationships, ideas, and actions.
- Bridge disciplines and sectors.
- Celebrate what’s working, and name what’s not.
- Push the civic tech movement forward — with values at the core.
