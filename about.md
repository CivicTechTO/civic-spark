Civic Spark is a people-organized gathering created by volunteers from the Civic Tech Toronto community. We’re designers, developers, public servants, organizers, and community builders who care deeply about how technology, data, and design can serve the public good.

This isn’t a corporate event — it’s a collaborative effort grounded in care, curiosity, and community. We’re here to hold space for real stories, meaningful relationships, and the hard, hopeful work of civic action.

This year also marks 10 years of Civic Tech Toronto — and we’re using this moment to reflect, reconnect, and reimagine what’s next.

## Our Vision

We envision a vibrant, people-centered civic tech ecosystem where communities use technology, organizing, and design to tackle real-world challenges — collaboratively, equitably, and creatively.

Civic Spark is a space to:

- Spark new relationships, ideas, and actions
- Bridge disciplines and sectors
- Celebrate what’s working, and name what’s not
- Push the civic tech movement forward — with values at the core

## Partners & Collaborators

We’re grateful to be working alongside a growing network of community organizations, institutions, and supporters who share our commitment to the public good.
