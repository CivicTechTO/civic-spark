Civic and social issues are often comparable in different cities, even across the border. In this session we'll hear from civic tech practitioners from across our larger region, about the projects they're working on, and civic tech's role, locally. It'll wrap up with an exploration about how civic tech community groups might learn from each other, share resources, and collaborate to make a bigger impact.
