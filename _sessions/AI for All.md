This session explores how artificial intelligence can be both a boon and a challenge for marginalized and underrepresented communities. We will discuss strategies to ensure AI-driven innovation – from accessible tech to education and data sovereignty – bridges divides instead of widening them, highlighting how Canada can lead with empathy, inclusion, and responsible innovation.
