Civic challenges are complex, often making it difficult or impossible to fully understand the nuances and needs of those affected. We can learn more and design solutions that are stronger when they’re shaped by the people most affected. In this panel, three experienced civic engagement practitioners share practical lessons and personal stories from working directly with communities. 

Hear from Climate Resilient Cities’ Helena Yu and Kate Macdonald about their work better equipping communities to adapt to climate change, as well as Nava’s Andrew Do reflecting on work with participant advisory councils and user research on benefit programs. Moderated by civic designer and consultant Meghan Hellstern, expect an exciting mix of actionable insights, lessons learned, and inspiration for anyone looking to meaningfully involve stakeholders in their work.
