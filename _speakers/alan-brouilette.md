18F Chief of Staff (Emeritus) Alan Brouilette spent nine and a half very good years as a federal employee of the United States despite his distrust of government and dislike of technology. After a sixteen year career working for ESPN, ABC News, Ameriprise Financial, Gogo Inflight Internet, and himself, Alan found in 18F the opportunity to build a humane workplace. Alan is a native of Chicago, a town that embraces soft power and understands the value of both friendship and Family to professional success. _(Capisce?)_ Alan is currently working with state and local governments to help them understand the transformative power of culture and community.
